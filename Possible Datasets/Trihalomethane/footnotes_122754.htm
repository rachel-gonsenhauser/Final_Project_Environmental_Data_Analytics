													<li><p>Data provided by state and local Environmental Health Tracking Programs. Data are derived from state databases associated with Safe Drinking Water Act. States without data shown here may have data available through their state databases for drinking water.</p></li>
													<li><p>Disinfection byproducts (DBP) refer to a family of chemicals that form when disinfectants, such as chlorine, used in water treatment react with bromide and/or naturally occurring organic matter in the water, for example, decomposing plant material.</p></li>
													<li><p>The DBP covered by these data include Trihalomethanes (THM). THMs that are regulated include Chloroform, Bromoform, Bromodichloromethane, and Dibromochloromethane. </p></li>
													<li><p>Drinking water DBP concentrations are based on samples taken from public community water systems (CWS). Data from seasonal and emergency sources were not included.</p></li>
													<li><p>The Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) for THMs is 80 micrograms per liter (or parts per billion).</p></li>
													<li><p>A water sample is designated as "non-detect" when the laboratory analysis cannot detect the analyte being measured.  A measure is designated as "non-detect" when samples from the same community water system (CWS) were non-detect for an entire year or quarter.</p></li>
													<li><p>The point on the map is the best estimate of the central location of the CWS.</p></li>
													<li><p>CWS without geographic information (latitudes and longitudes) will not appear on the map. Annual mean concentrations of analytes will be listed on the table.</p></li>

				<h3>Blanks or Missing Data</h3>
				<p>Blanks or missing data within the maps, tables, and charts may be due to one of the following reasons: (1) data were not collected, (2) data were collected but were not provided to CDC, or (3) data were incomplete or did not meet data quality standards.</p>

				<h3>Data Differences</h3>
				<p>Data presented on CDC's Tracking Network may differ from data that are presented on state or city tracking networks, state or city health department websites, and other source websites for the same measures. The differences may occur for many reasons, such as use of different population estimates, differences in processes and timing for updating data, or differences in how a measure is defined for environmental public health tracking purposes. Consult the indicators and measures descriptions and metadata that are provided on this site for more information.</p>

				<p><b>Derivation of measure</b></p>
				<p>Disinfection byproducts measures will be developed from water system attribute and water quality data stored in state Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) databases such as the Safe Drinking Water Information System (SDWIS/State). Trihalomethanes comprise chloroform, bromodichloromethane, dibromochloromethane, bromoform and their sum, denoted total trihalomethanes (TTHM). Haloacetic acids comprise trichloroacetic acid, dichloroacetic acid, monochloroacetic acid, dibromoacetic acid, monobromoacetic acid, and their sum, denoted HAA5. Data will be cleaned and transformed to a standard format. Analytical results of drinking water samples (usually taken at entry points to the distribution system or representative sampling points after treatment) will be used in conjunction with information about each CWS (such as service population and latitude and longitude of representative location of the CWS service area) to generate the measures.</p>

				<p><p>The current measures are derived for CWS only. Transient non-community water systems, which are regulated by EPA, may also be an important source of DBPs exposure.&nbsp; Measures do not account for the variability in sampling, numbers of sampling repeats, and variability within systems.&nbsp; Concentrations in drinking water cannot be directly converted to exposure, because water consumption varies by climate, level of physical activity, and between people. Due to errors in estimating populations, the measures may overestimate or underestimate the number of affected people.</p></p>
