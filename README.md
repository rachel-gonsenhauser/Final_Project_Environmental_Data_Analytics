# Repository Title: Final_Project_Environmental_Data_Analytics

## Summary

<describe the purpose of this repository, the information it contains, and any relevant analysis goals. What, why, where, when, how?>

This repository will house all materials for my final project for Environmental Data Analytics. My project will seek to examine the occurence of water quality contaminants and their potential relationship to median household income of the county, size of the community water system (CWS), the state in which the CWS is located, and so on. 

Preliminary research questions:
Is median household income correlated with the occurrence drinking water contaminants such as arsenic, PFAS, trihalomethane, and uranium?
Does a high concentration of one contaminant correlate with that of another?
Does the size of the CWS or the geographic location of the system correlate with the occurennce of these contaminants?
Do the concentrations of these contaminants vary in one particular location over time?

## Database Information

<describe the origin of all data in the repository, including data collected from outside sources and new data generated by the investigator(s). If data was accessed from an outside database, the date(s) of data access should also be included.>

Data was collected from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Environmental Public Health Tracking Network. This tool can be found at: https://ephtracking.cdc.gov/DataExplorer/#/. Data was accessed on February 26, 2020. 

Separate datasets from this source were combined by the data assembler into one processed dataset for analyses.
