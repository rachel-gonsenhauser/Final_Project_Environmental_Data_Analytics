# Final_Project_Environmental_Data_Analytics

Name: Rachel Gonsenhauser

This repository will house all materials for my final project for Environmental Data Analytics. My project will seek to examine the occurence of water quality contaminants and their potential relationship to median household income of the county, size of the community water system (CWS), the state in which the CWS is located, and so on. 

Preliminary research questions:
Is median household income correlated with the occurrence drinking water contaminants such as arsenic, PFAS, trihalomethane, and uranium?
Does a high concentration of one contaminant correlate with that of another?
Does the size of the CWS or the geographic location of the system correlate with the occurennce of these contaminants?
Do the concentrations of these contaminants vary in one particular location over time?
